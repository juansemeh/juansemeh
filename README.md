<h1 align="center">Hello.</h1>
<p align="center"> I am a developer-in-training, currently pursuing a degree in Software Analysis and Development (ADSO) at SENA. My focus is on learning to build robust, secure, and scalable applications. I am highly motivated to learn new technologies and refine my skills to become a valuable asset in the IT field. <b> (Or, in less corporate-speak: I enjoy making computers do things they probably shouldn't.)</b> </p>

<h2 align="center"> Security & DevOps Inclinations</h2>

<p align="center"> My primary fascination lies at the intersection of code, infrastructure, and security. I'm delving into the dark arts of DevOpsâ€”not just writing code, but architecting the resilient and secure systems it runs on. Because what good is a feature if it's an open door? </p>
